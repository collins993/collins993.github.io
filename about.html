            <p>I'm a guy filled with crispness, always motivated and the will to learn more and more everytime.  
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Speaking of learning, i have only begun my journey to work with skilled and more experience developers, I'm the kind of guy that gets excited at the fact i haven't perfomed a project in a certain way or have never worked on a particular kind of project, why you ask? Because it just shows there is always much to learn and ways to improve, what could be better that learning? Nothing!!
            <br/>
            <br/>
                I have programmed in languages like Java script, worked with CSS and HTML, but since I started Java and Android few months ago I couldn’t focus on anything else.
                <br/>
            <br/>
                During my Android journey I have learned to create exciting android applications, using the Android Studio software, I've enjoyed using the matterial design components, working with Api's and SQL, as well as Firebase, I’m passionate about programming and hope to learn more with time.
